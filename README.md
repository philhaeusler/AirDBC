AirDBC
======

Local Database Connectivity for Adobe AIR applications.

Introduction
------------
AirDBC provides AIR 3 and later desktop applications access to ODBC data sources.  It's still
early days yet, but the general idea is working OK.  This will be useful to me, i hope it's
useful to you too.

More polish will be coming soon.
